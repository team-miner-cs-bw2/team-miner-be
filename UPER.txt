UPER

1. Build Map
--> either manually build it through insomnia or do an algo

--> Things to consider:

You will be able to progress with future tasks much more quickly if you log ALL room info during your
initial traversal / map building (not just room numbers & exits)

^ this suggest to log the map as a whole to be more efficient?

2. Wise Explorer

--> Things to consider: (Graphutil.py)
An accurate map is the wise explorer's best friend. By predicting the ID of the destination room, you can reduce your action cooldown by 50%.

^ this suggest that we need to build a path using Graph specifically DFS (which search for the shortest node)
it will be efficient in traversing the map once there's a path already just like our sprint challenge?


3.  Treasure

You may have noticed the small treasure lying in the room

--> Things to consider:
To traverse the player we need an algo in searching for the rooms we might use BFS(to search for rooms for the player to traverse?)
